    <section><title>Apache MyFaces Project Bylaws</title>

      <p>This document defines the bylaws under which the Apache MyFaces
      project operates. It defines the roles and responsibilities of
      the project, who may vote, how voting works, how conflicts are
      resolved, etc.</p>

      <p>MyFaces is a project of the <link
      href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/">Apache Software
      Foundation</link>.  The foundation holds the copyright on Apache
      code including the code in the MyFaces codebase. The <link
      href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/faq.html">foundation
      FAQ</link> explains the operation and background of the
      foundation.</p>

      <p>MyFaces is typical of Apache projects in that it operates under
      a set of principles, known collectively as the "Apache Way". If
      you are new to Apache development, please refer to the <link
      href=" http://incubator.apache.org/">Incubator project</link>
      for more information on how Apache projects operate.</p>
    </section>

    <section><title>Roles and Responsibilities</title>

      <p>Apache projects define a set of roles with associated rights
      and responsibilities. These roles govern what tasks an
      individual may perform within the project. The roles are defined
      in the following sections.</p>

      <section><title>Users</title>
  
        <p>The most important participants in the project are people
        who use our software. The majority of our developers start out
        as users and guide their development efforts from the user's
        perspective.</p>

        <p>Users contribute to the Apache projects by providing
        feedback to developers in the form of bug reports and feature
        suggestions. As well, users participate in the Apache
        community by helping other users on mailing lists and user
        support forums.</p>
      </section>

      <section><title>Developers</title>
  
        <p>All of the volunteers who are contributing time, code,
        documentation, or resources to the MyFaces Project. A developer
        that makes sustained, welcome contributions to the project may
        be invited to become a Committer, though the exact timing of
        such invitations depends on many factors.</p>
      </section>

      <section><title>Committers</title>
  
        <p>The project's Committers are responsible for the project's
        technical management. All committers have write access to the
        project's source repositories. Committers may cast binding
        votes on any technical discussion regarding the project.</p>

        <p>All Developers who are already committers for any other
        Apache code-base automatically obtain commit access to the
        MyFaces project as well.</p>

        <p>Committer access is by invitation only and must be approved
        by lazy consensus of the active PMC members. A Committer is
        considered emeritus by their own declaration or by not
        contributing in any form to the project for over six
        months. An emeritus committer may request reinstatement of
        commit access from the PMC. Such reinstatement is subject to
        lazy consensus of active PMC members.</p>

        <p>Commit access can be revoked by a unanimous vote of all the
        active PMC members (except the committer in question if they
        are also a PMC member).</p>

        <p>All Apache committers are required to have a signed
        Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file with the Apache
        Software Foundation. There is a <link
        href="http://www.apache.org/dev/committers.html">Committer
        FAQ</link> which provides more details on the requirements for
        Committers.</p>

        <p>A committer who makes a sustained contribution to the
        project may be invited by or ask the PMC to become a member of
        the PMC. The form of contribution is not limited to code. It
        can also include code review, helping out users on the mailing
        lists, documentation, etc.</p>
      </section>

      <section><title>Project Management Committee</title>
  
        <p>The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache MyFaces was
        created by a resolution of the board of the Apache Software
        Foundation on 18th February 2004. The PMC is responsible to
        the board and the ASF for the management and oversight of the
        Apache MyFaces codebase. The responsibilities of the PMC
        include</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Deciding what is distributed as products of the Apache
          MyFaces project.  In particular all releases must be approved
          by the PMC.</li>
      
          <li>Maintaining the project's shared resources, including
          the codebase repository, mailing lists, websites.</li>
      
          <li>Speaking on behalf of the project.</li>
      
          <li>Resolving license disputes regarding products of the
          project.</li>
      
          <li>Nominating new PMC members and committers.</li>
          
          <li>Maintaining these bylaws and other guidelines of the
          project.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Membership of the PMC is by invitation only and must be
        approved by a lazy consensus of active PMC members. A PMC
        member is considered "emeritus" by their own declaration or by
        not contributing in any form to the project for over six
        months. An emeritus member may request reinstatement to the
        PMC. Such reinstatement is subject to lazy consensus of the
        active PMC members. Membership of the PMC can be revoked by an
        unanimous vote of all the active PMC members other than the
        member in question.</p>

        <p>The chair of the PMC is appointed by the ASF board. The
        chair is an office holder of the Apache Software Foundation
        (Vice President, Apache MyFaces) and has primary responsibility
        to the board for the management of the projects within the
        scope of the MyFaces PMC. The chair reports to the board
        quarterly on developments within the MyFaces project.  The PMC
        may consider the position of PMC chair annually and if
        supported by 2/3 Majority may recommend a new chair to the
        board.  Ultimately, however, it is the board's responsibility
        who it chooses to appoint as the PMC chair.</p>
      </section>

    <section><title>Decision Making</title>

      <p>Within the MyFaces project, different types of decisions require
      different forms of approval. For example, the previous section
      describes several decisions which require "lazy consensus"
      approval. This section defines how voting is performed, the
      types of approvals, and which types of decision require which
      type of approval.</p>

      <section><title>Voting</title>
  
        <p>Decisions regarding the project are made by votes on the
        primary project mailing list (general@MyFaces.apache.org). Where
        necessary, PMC voting may take place on the private MyFaces PMC
        mailing list - this is generally true for votes on people,
        i.e. electing new committers or PMC members or removing these
        rights.  Votes are clearly indicated by subject line starting
        with [VOTE] or [PMC-VOTE]. Votes may contain multiple items
        for approval and these should be clearly separated. Voting is
        carried out by replying to the vote mail. Voting may take four
        flavours</p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>+1</th>
            <td>"Yes" "Agree," or "the action should be performed." In
            general, this vote also indicates a willingness on the
            behalf of the voter in "making it happen"</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>+0</th>
            <td>This vote indicates a willingness for the action under
            consideration to go ahead. The voter, however will not be
            able to help.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>-0</th>
            <td>This vote indicates that the voter does not, in
            general, agree with the proposed action but is not
            concerned enough to prevent the action going ahead.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>-1</th>
            <td>This is a negative vote. On issues where consensus is
            required,this vote counts as a <strong>veto</strong>. All
            vetoes must contain an explanation of why the veto is
            appropriate. Vetoes with no explanation are void. It may
            also be appropriate for a -1 vote to include an
            alternative course of action.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>All participants in the MyFaces project are encouraged to show
        their agreement with or against a particular action by
        voting. For technical decisions, only the votes of active
        committers are binding. Non binding votes are still useful for
        those with binding votes to understand the perception of an
        action in the wider MyFaces community. For PMC decisions, only
        the votes of PMC members are binding.</p>

        <p>Voting can also be applied to changes made to the MyFaces
        codebase. These typically take the form of a veto (-1) in
        reply to the commit message sent when the commit is made.</p>

      </section>
      <section><title>Approvals</title>
  
        <p>These are the types of approvals that can be
        sought. Different actions require different types of
        approvals</p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Consensus</th>
            <td>For this to pass, all voters with binding votes must
            vote and there can be no binding vetoes (-1). Consensus
            votes are rarely required due to the impracticality of
            getting all eligible voters to cast a vote.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Lazy Consensus</th>
            <td>Lazy consensus requires 3 binding +1 votes and no
            binding vetoes.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Lazy Majority</th>
            <td>A lazy majority vote requires 3 binding +1 votes and
            more binding +1 votes that -1 votes.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Lazy Approval</th>
            <td>An action with lazy approval is implicitly allowed
            unless a -1 vote is received, at which time, depending on
            the type of action, either lazy majority or lazy consensus
            approval must be obtained.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>2/3 Majority</th>
            <td>Some actions require a 2/3 majority of active
            committers or PMC members to pass. Such actions typically
            affect the foundation of the project (e.g. adopting a new
            codebase to replace an existing product). The higher
            threshold is designed to ensure such changes are strongly
            supported. To pass this vote requires at least 2/3 of
            binding vote holders to vote +1</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </section>
      <section><title>Vetoes</title>
  
        <p>A valid, binding veto cannot be overruled. If a veto is
        cast, it must be accompanied by a valid reason explaining the
        reasons for the veto. The validity of a veto, if challenged,
        can be confirmed by anyone who has a binding vote. This does
        not necessarily signify agreement with the veto - merely that
        the veto is valid.</p>

        <p>If you disagree with a valid veto, you must lobby the
        person casting the veto to withdraw their veto. If a veto is
        not withdrawn, the action that has been vetoed must be
        reversed in a timely manner.</p>
      </section>

      <section><title>Actions</title>
  
        <p>This section describes the various actions which are
        undertaken within the project, the corresponding approval
        required for that action and those who have binding votes over
        the action.</p>

            <th>Code Change</th>
            <td>A change made to a codebase of the project and

            <td>When the codebase for an existing, released product is
            to be replaced with an alternative codebase. If such a
            vote fails to gain approval, the existing code base will

            sub-projects within the project</td>
